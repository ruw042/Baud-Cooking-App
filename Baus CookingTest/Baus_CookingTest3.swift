  Baus CookingTest
  Description: This file is going to test the functionality of searching for ingredients. Basically after the user logged in
               with the right account name and account password, the user will be able to do searching in main page. The user
               can type in the ingredients that he or she is looking for and click the submit button, and then the search
               result will pop up. The user can then click on any search result in this page to see the details.
  Created by Group7 on 12/2/15.

  Scenario:
  GIVEN the user log in into the app and be at the main page

  WHEN the user input some ingredient in the TextField
  THEN the textField will present the ingredents that the user just typed

  WHEN user click on Submit botton
  THEN the app will navigate to the page with detailed recipe list and the I will be able to scroll down to view more receipes
