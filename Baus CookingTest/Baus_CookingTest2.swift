  Description: This file tests the log in functionality of the app. If the input username exist in the database,
               then the system will check the password that the user entered. If they match, then the user is able to log in.
               This file only test the valid input part, which means the input username and the password exist in the database.
  Created by Group7 on 12/2/15.

  Scenario:
  GIVEN at the log in page and type in the correct username and password

  WHEN I type in the user name at the "User" textField
  THEN the Text Field will actually present the username that the user just typed in
  
  WHEN I type in the password at the "Password" textField
  THEN the textField will present the securitied password that the user just typed in.

  WHEN I click the log in button
  THEN the app will navigate to the main page and I will be able to click the log out button to go back to the log in page
